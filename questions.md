Questions for review:

1. In order to "calculate agency shift-relief factor" - how can we get info on benefits CPD have for time off, sick days, etc?
2. How determine the performance measurement by community?
- Use existing 50% or 33% for CFS performance standard?
3. Do we want to map the number of resources available vs what is required? (Table 3.5 - page 50)
